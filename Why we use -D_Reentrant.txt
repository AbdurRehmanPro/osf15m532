Actually, the recommended way to compile with threads in GCC is using the -pthread option. It is equivalent to -lpthread -D_REENTRANT so you have actually no problem.

The flags do the following:

-lpthread instructs the linker to use the appropriate library versions for thread compatibility.

-D_REENTRANT tells the compiler to use the declarations necessary for thread usage.
